# Connnect-4-Game-Using-AI
Employs Minimax and Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithms
The GUI for both shubodh_minimax_final.py and shubodh_alphabeta_final.py is already included in these files itself, don't need to add the code for GUI separately. 

These files can be run directly to see the results. A summary of the results is presented in the "Submission_Details.docx" file.

However, GUI code has also been included in the file gui_final.py for separate reference.


For computation purposes, the game has been modified to a 4 * 4 board and the first player to place 3 coins adjacent to each other in any direction - horizontal, vertical and diagonal wins! 

Try finding out the weaknesses of the Alpha Beta Pruning player and try defeating it and email me if you succeed!
